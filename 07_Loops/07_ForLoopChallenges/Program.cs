//Loops Challenges:

//Bronze:
//Write a for loop to print the numbers 500 through 525.
//starting point i = 500; (initialization)
//boolean expression i<=525 (the loop will run as long as this is TRUE)
//i will increment up by one as long as bool value is TRUE

//Silver:
//Create a for loop to print the numbers from 0-100 by 5's.

//Gold:
//Create a for loop to print the numbers 1-100. 
//If it's divisible by both 3 and 5, print 'FizzBuzz' otherwise print the number.
//If the number is divisible by 3, print 'Fizz' instead of the number. 
//If it's divisible by 5, print 'Buzz', instead of the number.
